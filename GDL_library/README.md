This code is part of a library in development.

Here I share the modules I have been working on:

- data_representation: Contains diferent ways to create GDL representations from structures
  - Graphs
  - Voxels/grids
  - Point cloud
- dataset_creation: Uses other modulues to create full datasets of working representations
- feature_extraction: Creates features to populate representations
- featurizer: This allows selection of feature resolution to be used in representations:
  - Residue/amino-acid features
  - All atom features
